# Temperature-and-humidity-sensor

Temperature-and-humidity-sensor is a REST API application, which aims to improve  Spring Boot skills.
 The application includes two main components: sensor and measurement.
	The sensor simulates the action of a temperature sensor and determines whether it is raining or not. We can register a new sensor, change its name as well as delete it.
	Measurement is the reading that the sensor transmits.  The temperature measurements taken from the sensor are validated. 
	A REST API client is implemented, using which we can register a new sensor or send its readings.
